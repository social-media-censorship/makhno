/*
 * Makhno API design
 * The endpoint sequence described here is part of the Makhno suite. The purpose is to define a protocol by which a client can request reachability checks from our infrastructure.  ## There are some reserved words that we use in this document:  `target URL`: this is the URL of a social media platform that we want to monitor. the subjects covered in this framework, are, for the most part. `target URLs`. they can be youtube videos or facebook posts. we are talking about a social media platform URL (not all of them are supported, of course, and different versions prograd in supporting more and more of them)  `availabilityCheck`: is the action by which we verify that a `target URL` is accessible from a certain country.  `vantagePoint`: is a point in the Internet network from which the availabilityCheck is executed to a targetURL. They are identified by the nationality of the internet service provider hosting them.  `agent`: a tool executed from a `vantagePoint`, this tool connects to a `target URL` and verify if the content is reachable or not.  ## The purpose of Makhno, as you can guess, is to map whether a social media content is accessible from a nation or not.
